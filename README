MIDAS: agents part

	The agents within MIDAS use a NodeJS version of Eve to represent physical entities in a factory. 
	Documentation of Eve is available on http://almende.github.com/eve; documentation of MIDAS is not ready yet.

USAGE

	make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS
	clone this repo
	npm install
	cd MIDAS
	npm install
	node MIDAS/midasdemo

	This will launch a couple of agents communicating with one another. 
	Use the browser to access the simple UIs to see what's going on in the MIDAS agents.


NB	I know that the directory structure is not ideal, but it works well enough for now :-)
